# Task 3
## Door lock system with Arduino and RFID Module
RFID is a radio frequency identification system, this proect aims on making a door lock system which can be oppened or locked based on RFID module 
## DIY Apple AirTag
AirTag is a tracking device developed by Apple.AirTag is designed to act as a key finder, which helps people find personal objects. Though it is a useful gadget, apple being apple, it is very high priced for the use.This project aims in making our own replica of the Apple Airtags, which will have two of its most relevant features, precision tracking and sound alerts.
